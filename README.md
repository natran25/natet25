What's up! 👋 

My name is Nathan Tran and I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan studying Data Analytics. 
I just recently finished my Bachelor's also at Michigan this past May with a degree in Information Analysis and a minor in Applied Statistics.
I have knowledge in Python, SQL, R, and I have also used Tableau. 
I'm passionate about sports specifically any of the Chicago sports teams and of course Michigan sports too (GO BLUE! 〽️)! 
I'm eager to use data to help others in any way I can and I think it's super cool that data can be found anywhere!
